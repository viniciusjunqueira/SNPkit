# SNPkit (development version)

## Bug fixes

* `SNPDataLong`: relaxed validation of the `xref_path` slot to accept character
  vectors of any length (one entry per individual), resolving an error in
  `import_geno_list()` when datasets contained more than one individual.

* `qcSNPs()`: fixed a warning (`max` returning `-Inf`) and potential incorrect
  removal of all SNPs in a same-position group when all MAF values were `NA`.
  The first SNP in the group is now kept in that case.

# SNPkit 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN release.
